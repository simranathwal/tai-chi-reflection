# tai-chi-reflection
reflecting on in-class tai-chi experience. try not to write facts. Describe the experience.
The in-class tai-chi was an interesting experience. At first, the thought of trying to attempt the tai-chi poses was not appealing to myself. The idea of myself messing up and making a fool out of myself was uncomforting and embarassing. Throughout the experience, my thoughts changed and morphed into a more calm and less anxiety seeking scenerio. The tai-chi was oddly calming and had me relaxed. As I learned these two moves, I started to focus less on potentially embarassing myself and more on clearing my mind of any thoughts whether they be what I had to do later or what to eat for dinner. Trying to do and not think.
