# tai-chi-reflection
reflecting on in-class tai-chi experience. try not to write facts. Describe the experience.
The in-class tai-chi was an interesting experience. At first, the thought of trying to attempt the tai-chi poses was not an appealing thought. The idea of me messing up the pose and making a fool out of myself was rather unsettling. Throughout the experience, my thoughts began to have a more positive outlook. Tai-chi was actually calming and less anxiety provoking than I had assumed. The tai-chi was oddly comforting and had me relaxed. As I learned these two moves, I started to focus less on potentially embarassing myself and more on clearing my mind of any thoughts whether they be "what am I doing later" or "what am I going to eat for dinner". So trying to "do" rather than "think". It had been strangely motivating, in regards to how it can affect the nature of ones self.
